			<h2>What is a CTO</h2>
			<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
			<pre style="white-space: normal;">A Chief Technology Officer (CTO), "examines the short and long term needs of an organization, and utilizes capital to make investments designed to help the organization reach its objectives... 
[the CTO] is the highest technology executive position within a company and leads the technology or engineering department."</pre>
			<p>While defining pretty well what a CTO means, Wikipedia fails to actually describe its clear, definitive role in a startup company. They do not answer the basic question: <i>what does the CTO actually do</i>?<br /><br />
			This is off course not Wikipedia's fault, as they are compelled to describe the most broad definition of a CTO, shared by technological and non technological companies alike. And that's just not good enough for a startup wondering about the place of the CTO.<br /><br />
			This doc will attempt to address this question, and describe all the roles and duties of the CTO in a startup. Needless to say, this is just the base point and as the startup grows and begin to hire its common for the CTO to shed some of these responsibilities and transfer them to designated roles.</p>
			
			<h4>So without further ado, here's the definitive, detailed role of the CTO in a startup company!</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		
		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<h2>1. Architect</h2>
			<p>The CTO is the main architect of the software. This includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Choosing which technologies and infrastructures to use for the software components. This includes programming language, server infrastructures, testing framework, libraries, etc.</li>
				<li>Choosing development tools. This includes IDE, repositories, logging, etc.</li>
				<li>Design the software architecture, modules, and components.</li>
				<li>Building the dev roadmap, with coordination with the other founders regarding priority of features.</li>
				<li>Deciding on coding standards and development protocols.</li>
				<li>Writing and managing any software related documentation (for example company internal wiki page etc.).</li>
				<li>Designing the Database. This means choosing which DB to use, designing its tables / documents, etc.</li>
				<li>Constantly exploring new tools and technologies to improve development efficiency and product quality.</li>
				<li>When someone introduce a new tool or technology related to software development or server / service health, the CTO must examine and approve or reject it.</li>
				<li>When another founder or employee design a software component or a module, the CTO must review it and suggest changes if needed.</li>
				<li>The CTO should have the final word on all design decisions, as he is the founder with the deepest understanding of the general architecture.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Exceptions:</h4>
			<p>Without diminishing the list above, its important to remember that some architectural decisions can have financial or scheduling implications. The CTO should not make decisions that exceed the budget limit (for example buy a development tool that's too expensive) or make architectural choices that would take too long to develop while on a tight schedule.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		
		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<h2>2. Developer</h2>
			<p>Since it takes some time for a startup to start hiring devs, the CTO is also the main (and often only) developer on the team. This includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Developing all the software components and services of the startup.</li>
				<li>Building MVPs and other experiments that require coding.</li>
				<li>Testing the product and writing automatic tests when possible.</li>
				<li>Overseeing any additional development force (outsourcing, other founder temporarily helping with dev, new employee, etc.).</li>
				<li>If the startup provides a service or an API, monitoring and assuring its health and quality.</li>
				<li>Breaking down development tasks and evaluating dev times and release dates. The CTO should also be responsible to learn and improve from scheduling mistakes.</li>
				<li>Make releases and manage versions history and binary files, if needed.</li>
				<li>Developing or providing scripts and tools the other founders might need and can't find.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		
		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<h2>3. Team Leader</h2>
			<p>When the startup start hiring devs its the CTO's job to manage them and be the team leader. This includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Breaking down tasks for the dev team.</li>
				<li>Training new employees (or overseer their training by another team member).</li>
				<li>Doing code & design reviews.</li>
				<li>Making sure the dev team produce quality and tested code.</li>
				<li>Monitoring the dev team's progress and making sure they keep up with the schedule and roadmap.</li>
				<li>Making sure the dev team comply with the coding standards and protocols.</li>
				<li>Doing occasional talks with the team to make sure they are happy and in-sync with the company direction.</li>
				<li>Building the culture of the dev teams.</li>
				<li>Overseeing the entire dev cycle, from initial designs to delivery.</li>
				<li>Helping them with coding when needed.</li>
				<li>Recruiting and evaluating new hires - all new devs must be approved by the CTO.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The CTO should also be the main authority devs should report critical problems to.</p>
			<h4>After passing the baton</h4>
			<p>Usually the CTO step back from this role when the dev team grows big and one of the devs is experienced enough to become the team leader himself.<br />
			When this happens the CTO gradually step down from being a direct team leader and becomes a more higher level manager.<br /><br />
			The relations between the CTO and the new team leader can vary, and the CTO direct involvement in the dev team should be up to him to decide.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		
		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<h2>4. IT</h2>
			<p>Just like with devs, most startups start without a proper IT team. Its up for the CTO to take up that role until IT is hired. This includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting up and maintaining the company servers, databases, and all related services.</li>
				<li>Making sure the servers and data are secured.</li>
				<li>Managing things like domains, SSL certificates, CDN, and other server-related and web components.</li>
				<li>Building and maintain landing pages and other misc services.</li>
				<li>Helping the non techy founders with their IT problems.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		
		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<h2>5. Founder & Executive</h2>
			<p>With all the roles and responsibilities above its important to remember that the CTO is also a founder and an executive-level personnel, and as such he is entitled to be involved in the strategy planning and big decisions of the company.</p>
			<p class="remove-from-contract">Its easy for a CTO to gradually "sink down" into just the architect & dev roles, especially since there's so much work there, but its important that the CTO remains an integral force in the company's direction and be in complete sync with the other founders, aware and part of all major decisions.</p>
			<p class="remove-from-contract">While this section may sound redundant, we actually heard a lot of complains about founders that feel their CTO is not involved enough in the company management, or CTOs that sometimes feel "left out" from important decisions. Therefore this section was included.</p>

			<h4>That's It! Some Final Words...</h4>
			<p>Every startup has its own dynamics and different founders want different things.<br />While this doc define the most common roles of the CTO in a startup, it should be taken as a general guideline and not as a hard set of rules.<br /><br />
			With that said, sometimes its important to coordinating expectations upfront. See 'Using This Doc' for more details.

			<h2>Using This Doc</h2>
			<p>
			If you enter a startup as the CTO and you're the only techie guy, there shouldn't be any problem.<br /> 
			However, if you enter a startup with other techie founders and you choose / get to be the CTO, its important to coordinate and be clear about your role and responsibilities upfront, to avoid uncomfortable collisions in the future.<br /><br />
			To do so, you can use this very page. Simply click on the button below to get a "contract", print it, and have the other founders read, agree and sign on it.<br /><br />
			It has no real legal obligation but if in the future there are questions about your part and you feel like someone is stepping into your territory, you can politely show them this mutual understanding they agreed on and hopefully it will help resolve the matter in a peaceful way. <br /><br />

			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>This page is the result of an extensive research which included interviewing scores of founders from different roles and companies, big and small.<br />
			All the bullets that appear in this doc are things we heard from multiple sources of different companies. Controversial points that some founders disagreed with or things we heard from only one or few founders were not included. <br /><br />
			We mostly talked with CEOs and CTOs, but few other roles also participated like CMOs, CIOs etc. <br /><br />
			Every interview began with the following questions:
			<ul>
				<li>How do you see the role of the CTO in your company?</li>
				<li>What does your CTO actually do every day?</li>
				<li>What are the other things the CTO do which are not daily basis?</li>
				<li>Does your CTO manage anyone? If you don't have any employees yet, will he manage anyone in the future?</li>
				<li>What are the "privileges" of being a CTO?</li>
				<li>What are the duties of being a CTO?</li>
				<li>Where do you see your CTO in the future?</li>
				<li>What do you think the CTO loves about his job?</li>
				<li>What do you think the CTO hates about his job?</li>
				<li>How does the daily interaction between the CTO and the other founders looks like?</li>
			</ul>
			and those who were more talkative were also asked about points that other founders previously raised (if they agree or disagree with).
